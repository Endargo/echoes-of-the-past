# Overview

For the last century, this part of the Reaching Woods was avoided by common folks and seasoned adventurers alike. Stray undead hordes and packs of mutated animals can scare off even well-trained paladins of Elturgard, and those who dare to enter the fog come back changed, losing their minds and shortly going insane, IF they come back, even. This drow, Seimur, is saying he _"found a safe way to travel the Wood of Echoes, and needs your company to enter long-lost land and uncover it's secrets. For quite some gold, of course."_ Do you really trust him? Hell no. Do you need gold? Hell yes! Besides, you are always up to an adventure. Let's just hope it won't be your last...

This campaign is designed for a party of 4-5 characters of level 7, and offers multiple opportunities to level up individual characters.

Suggested changes to RAW: 1) Reading a spell does not require having appropriate spell slot available (still, character should have it in a spellbook for one of it's classes)

# Prologue
![Lucky Steps](img/locations/lucky-steps.png)
_Lucky Steps Inn_

Background: all characters were approached by Seimur separately, prior to adventure start, and all he said in the end is "Lucky Steps, after dusk, last day of this week".

## Arrival at Lucky Steps Inn
![Seimur](img/chars/seimur.png)
_Seimur_

The adventure starts when characters one by one arrive at Lucky Steps inn, a meeting point mentioned by elf. When they arrive, read the following:

_TO DO: Lucky Steps flavour text_

Inside they will find half-empty tavern hall, where innkeeper will point to a table besides the counter, where Seimur sits, covering his face with a cape, to remain unrecognised. Seimur will greet characters one by one, and when everyone arrives, he suggests that adventurers introduce themselves. In the end, he will describe himself as a lone traveller, who happened to get hands on an ancient elven writings describing forbidden rituals, how to create barriers, illusions and charms, and also how to resist this kind of magic.

He bevieves some of the magic resembles such in the Wood of Echoes, and if it was used, elves of the past wanted to hide something exteremely valuable. He wanted to do the job with his brother Dairon, but, unfortunately, Dairon thinks it's too risky and not worth a shot, so Seimur decided to look for help elsewhere (WIS (Insight) check DC 18 reveals that Seimur is hiding something. Maybe he doesn't want to scare you off just like his brother?). He is glad that some experinced adventurers were interested in this endeavour. At the end, he says, that he got an old map of the place, and paid and artifacter to create a magical item which will help all of them to travel safely through the fog. One more thing, he needs to get his chronometer back from local gang.

He points at another table in the opposite corner, where a company of five men is drinking beer and playing dice. He needed some money to prepare for the quest, and there was no choice other than selling his father's pocket watch to these Singing Rats, but when he wanted to get the relic back, Rats asked for triple the price. Their leader, Piper, is in the posession of the named watch. Would the party help Seimur retrieve the memory?

Here DM by Seimur's name will try to convince players to retrieve the family watch (success will have an impact during the main part of the adventure). If players disagree despite the effort, go to a long rest and skip the Singing Rats confrontation.

## Confronting the Singing Rats
![Singing Rats](img/chars/singing-rats.png)
_Singing Rats_

![Piper](img/chars/piper.png)
_Piper_

Players approach the table, where the band is loudly shouting. The leader, Piper, is not playing or drinking, he is sitting separately, watching the party, but doesn't join. When players approaches him, he commands the rest of the goons to leave the place. After a moment, there is only him, three memebers of the gang, and player characters that are left in the tavern hall. He offers to buy out the watch for 500G, but eventually players can discover other options listed below:

|Challenge|Goal|Success|Failure
|---|---|---|---|
|Buy Out|500G|Piper returns the watch|Piper refuses to return the watch, but leaves other options open|
|Play the Dice|(A)DEX (Sleight of Hand) check DC 25 OR (B) WIS (Perception) check DC 15 (by a character who knows Thieves' Cant) AND DEX (Sleight of Hand) check DC 15|Piper returns the watch; if caught cheating, Rats force the fight later|Piper refuses to return the watch, and demands 200G; if caught cheating or players refuse to pay, Rats force the fight later|
|Arm Wrestle|STR (Athletics) check DC 20 with disadvantage|Piper returns the watch|Piper refuses to return the watch, and demands 200G; if players refuse to pay, Rats force the fight later|
|Duel Proposition|CHA (Persuasion) check DC 20; character shouldn't have Extra Attack feature|Piper agrees to honest duel with the character who convinced him, outside of the tavern|Piper seemingly agrees to a duel; Rats force the fight later|
|Duel|Reduce his HP to 0; spells are prohibited|Piper is furious after loss and commands his bandits to attack you, but he lost their respect, and forced to return the watch|Piper refuses to return the watch and demands 500G from other characters; if players refuse to pay, Rats force the fight|

If players are able to retrieve the watch, Seimur is happily asking them to get outside for a second to discuss the plan for tomorrow: you rest in the inn, next morning he takes the cabin to the edge of the wood, then you walk two miles until reaching the fog. Here he will activate the artifact, and lead the party to an ancient keep, where they should retrieve something valuable.

When players head back to the tavern, they are met by Piper and three of his goons, in case fight was triggered previously (except for Duel scenario). He walks up to the character who did the trigger action, say that he is admiring character's skills, and at that moment character is attacked by one of the bandits hiding in the bushes. This is ranged sneak attack made with +6 bonus and advantage, dealing 1d8 + 3 + 4d6 Piercing damage. Piper comments the result, and draws his dagger, starting the fight. Seimur joins the adventurers, facing three Bandits (crossbow), two Bandits (knife), one Berserker and Piper himself.

All bandits drop their weapons and armor, and 600G in total, Piper drops dagger +1 and possibly watch. After the fight, Seimur will thank you and offer a night in the tavern at his expense. Do a long rest over the night and continue the adventure.

There will be one more chance to get the watch, if players didn't get it before and didn't trigger the fight, by pickpocketing drunk Piper, DEX (Sleight of Hand) check DC18 (distraction gives an advantage), on the 2nd floor of the tavern before going to sleep.

## Road to the Wood of Echoes

In the morning, your travels begin. Seimur greets the party and invites to enter the cart. The cab rides for about 3-4 hours before stumbling over Elturgard knights patrolling the area. The group consists of three Vengeance paladins, their squires and one priest of Lathander. Seeing them, Seimur will hide his head under the hood and try to remain silent.

![Elturgard Patrol](img/chars/elturgard-patrol.png)
_Elthurgard patrol_

One of the paladins starts asking questions about the intent, because adventurers approaching Elturgard border. Shortly, another paladin will seemingly recognize Seimur, and claim that elf stole his purse. Group can try to talk their way out of the situation, or fight the patrol. Knights drop their armor and weapons, and 200G.

Either way, when party continues travelling, Seimur will break the silence and thank adveturers for saving him once again. Party can persuade him into admitting that he in fact stole his purse, because said palading wasn't acting nicely towards common folk. Several hours later, party arrive at the edge of the wood. Read this:

_TO DO: Wood of Echoes flavour text_

![Wood of Echoes](img/locations/wood-of-echoes.png)
_Wood of Echoes_

Cart leaves you at the last crossroad, and Seimur puts his backpack on the ground. He gets the map, consults it for a minute, and points the direction. Then he gets strange lantern, says a spell and it lights up with the blue color. Drow is ready to enter the fog.

Here it is recommended to complete a short rest if party fought Elturgard patrol. Then continue the adventure by traveling to Sunrise Keep.

# Major Locations and Events

This chapter contains descriptions for all the major locations in the Wood of Echoes. As mentioned at the end of Prologue, party first enters Sunrise Keep, and then will travel across the map to other destinations. Map of the wood is found in appendix D, players will get access to it at the end of Sunrise Keep arc. It is split into hexagonal tiles, moving from tile to tile takes around 30 minutes and equals 1 mile travel. When party arrive at a tile for the first time, they either find Major location, which are pre-determined but hidden from the players, or encounter Minor location or event, which can be rearranged and reassigned to uncovered tiles before the session. All characters have to move on global map as one group, since they have only one Fey Lantern which allows for safe travel. This limitation is lifted on local maps.

Additionally, if in prologue party was able to return the pocket watch, after completing Sunrise Keep arc they will have access to the in-game time tracker. DM decides how it should look like. Sun is rising at 6AM and setting at 8PM, and time of day determines the level of danger during exploration and rests. Appendix D contains different maps for night and day scenarios, Appendix C contains decision tables which can help to determine outcome of repeating events.

## Abandoned Village

### Arriving at Abandoned Village

![](img/locations/abandoned-village.png)
_Abandoned Village_

When players first arrive at Abandoned Village, read this:

_TO DO:_

After passing the first house, group is attacked by a pack of six fey wolves and one shadow wolf. If fight is not over in one round, Renvel will come to help at the start of round two. Then he will talk to adventurers and ask them to meet him at a house later. In fight is over in one round, he won't appear, instead group will meet him only when stumbling across his house.

![Renvel](img/chars/renvel.png)
_Renvel_

### Discovering Abandoned Village

Abandoned Village has the following points of interest.

Renvel's House, good condition, west part of the village. Renvel lives there. Will meet the group and offer a shelter, maybe some resources.

Well, center of the village. WIS (Perception) check DC10 will help to find a clover leaf cut on one of the bricks. Toss 1G to get heroic inspiration, only works once a day. On the bottom, 100G can be found, but going down prevents party from getting heroic inspiration.

Merchant's house, east part of the village, poor condition. Locked chest (DC15) contains 800G.

House of Derek and Maya, ruined, south. Has a diary page written by Maya and Flower Ornated Lockbox (DC25 or Flower Ornated Key, found randomly in the Wood of Echoes). Note says the following:

>_I was dreaming about leaving the village since my childhood. How lucky I am to have Derek! He promised to take me to Baldur's Gate at the next full moon, and I'm so excited! Can't wait for him coming back from the hunt, and we'll start packing together._

Inside the lockbox, Pearl of Power is found. Lockbox is charmed, so that it will break if verbal spell is cast directly onto it, crushing the pearl (like Knock).

Buried treasure chest, under the ground in north-west house remains. Inside the chest, 1000G can be found. Hint for finding the chest can be found in random event ???.

### Renvel's Fate

After finding Renvel in his house, he tells that he is living here in wilderness so nobody is bothered by his appearance, since he's a shapeshifter. At the edge of the wood noone is risking to seek for him, so he can safely live, hunt small animals and provide for himself. He suggests a party to stay for the night, and restock, giving each party member a daily ration for the night.

In the morning, a group of paladins arrives, led by handsome blonde man with shining sword, who introduces as Damian, Crusader of Torm and will of Elturgard. He is here to find Renvel, and bring him to justice for being a monster. Players can side with Renvel, triggering the fight against the whole group, or give him out. Paladins execute him in place, and if anyone of the paladin group from prologue survived, Damian will comment that we helped to cover up another criminal earlier and force the fight anyway.

![](img/chars/damian-crusader-of-torm.png)
_Damian, Crusader of Torm_

All enemies drop weapons and armor, Damian has Flame Tongue Longsword.

After the fight, if Renvel survived, he says it's too dangerous to stay here any longer and planning to leave. Before that, he says he could train someone from the group to become more efficient in battle and surviving in wilderness, granting a level up to a character who is still level 7.

Additionally, if party is not full, he can join the group as level 7 Barbarian, Path of the Beast, Shifter, Outlander.

## Crypt of Sehanine

### Opening the Way

![Statue oh Sehanine](img/locations/statue-of-sehanine.png)
_Statue of Sehanine_

When players first arrive at the statue, read this:

_TO DO_

Sacrificing a spell slot or casting Detect Magic or similar spell will cause the mysterious voice say the following lines:

>Храню вечный покой  
Всех тех кто здесь уснет  
Лишь в свете утренней звезды  
Откроется проход

Placing Rusty Morning Star in the hand of a statue will turn it into Slumbering Morning Star, make water level drop and reveal a secret undergound passage to a crypt. If held by a Fey, morning star will automatically levitate and place itself in the hands of the statue, turning into Slumbering Morning Star, opening the way and then come back to character hands. Other races should retrieve the weapon by hand. Party should go down in order to continue the adventure.

### Discovering Crypt of Sehanine

![Crypt of Sehanine](img/locations/crypt-of-sehanine.png)
_Entrance to the crypt of Sehanine_

Crypt has the following parts.

Main burial chamber, south part. First big room in the crypt, has several tombs in it. Disturbing the dead will summon ghosts for a fight. Inside 400G can be found.

Lord's burial chamber, east part. Locked by stone door. Has Sentinel Shield laying on the stone tomb, touching it triggers a fight with two ghosts and three skeleton lords.

Worshipers room, central part. Has a statue of a man closing his eye, like trying to hide from a light. Sacrificing a spell slot or casting Detect Magic or similar spell will cause the voice say the following lines:

>О, Странник  
Что несет нам свет  
Зажги звезду  
И пред Судьей держи ответ

After illuminating the statue with Slumbering Morning Star, the blue barrier will disappear and weapon will turn into the Awakened Morning Star.

Treasure room, south-west part. Opening the locked door triggers Cloudkill trap. Has a total of 5000G in treasures, but looting it will force the fight with the Judge later.

Hall of Trials, north part. Final trial will happen here.

### Final Trial
![Judge](img/chars/judge.png)
_The Judge_

When party enters hall of trial, they will see a mysterious figure in a cloak, holding a staff. He introduces as a Judge, and begins a trial. If party (1) has an Elf or another Fey character, who is (2) holding the Awakened Morning Star and (3)Neutral- or Good-aligned, and (4) party didn't touch the treasury, Judge will threat him as worthy and simply disappear, saying "One last step, Wanderer...". On the same place, lord's note will fly down to the floor with the following text:

>This is it. My daughter is going to marry this man. I am happy for her and angry at myself at the same time. He doesn't even carry Fey blood, but I guess, it doesn't matter. All I care about is a true Heir. If she will carry a boy, I can forgive her anything. Although, can I forgive myself?

If at least one condition is not met, he will animate two petrified archers and four swordsmen in the hall, starting a boss fight and locking the entrance with a force barrier. Killing the Judge will make him disappear and drop the same note.

After the fight, party can examine the far wall of the room, where two statue and one empty pedestal reside. Sacrificing a spell slot or casting Detect Magic or similar spell and touching one of the pedestals will cause the voice convince the caster to touch one of the objects.

If white statue is touched:
>Заветный дар  
В обьятьях твоих рук  
Верши последний шаг  
Избавь Наследника от мук

If black statue is touched:
>В ночи без звезд  
Нам править суждено  
Когда погаснет свет  
И превратится кровь врагов в вино

If empty pedestal is touched:
>Наследник не достоин  
Хоть верил до конца  
Верни же ты на место дар  
Не быть ему в руках лжеца

Depending on the starbearer choice, Awaken Morning Star will transform differently. If white statue was illuminated, hall lights with starlight, and Radiant Morning Star returns to the bearer. If black statue was illuminated, hall lights with bloodlight, and Corrupted Morning Star returns to the bearer. If bearer choses to place it on the empty pedestal instead, invisible force will shatter the weapon, diming all the lights, and leaving only tiny Shard of the Morning Star gleaming with light.

All the variations of Morning Star require attunement to activate magical properties, and count as a Gift requred to enter the final chapter. Also, starbearer will receive a level up (or another character, if starbearer is already level 8).

## Mansion Gate

### Arriving at the Gate

![Mansion Gate](img/locations/mansion-gate.png)
_Mansion gate overgrown by fungus_

When party first arrive at the Gate, read this:

_TO DO:_

Before the gate, players see young female elf sitting on her knees and whispering. When she notices the party, she will start the dialogue, and once assured that there is no treat, introduce herself as Anariet, Springwarden, first circle druid of the Emerald Enclave.

![Anariet](img/chars/anariet-springwarden.png)
_Anariet, Springwarden of the Emerald Enclave_

She will tell that her order is hiding information about this part of wood, despite what's happening, and young druid decided to act on her own. She created magic necklace, which allows to travel the fog, and started exploring the woods. Local dangers are too much for the youngster, but still she was able to discover this gate, which is covered by fungi saplings and tentacles. Additionally, some kind of abjuration magic is present here. All she was able to discover is an entrance to a fungal cave not far from here, but it seems too dangerous to dive in alone.

Anariet asks adventurers to aid her in exploring the cave which connected to these mushrooms blocking the gate, in return offering nature's blessing. Then she shows the way to the cave (30 minutes of travel).

### Discovering Fungal Cave

![Fungal Cave](img/locations/fungal-cave.png)
_Fungal cave_

When party first arrives at Fungal Cave, read this:

_TO DO:_

Fungal Cave has the following points of interest.

Infested remains, south-east part. Inspecting them triggers the fight with one fungi abomination, four fungi hunters and three fungal zombies. Zombies can be looted for Guardian Emblem.

Treasure chest, it the river, east part. Contains 400G, Potion of Healing (2), Potion of Clairvoyance and a servant's note with the following text:

>I don't like what's happening here, at the lord's house. Everyone is getting suspicious, gossiping about his daughter. I am planning to leave soon, but before that, I have to hide my belongings somewhere safe.

Wooden bridge, center of the map. D20 roll determines if it breaks or not.

Narrow passage, north part. Having light sources will trigger fight with four fungal bats.

Fungal lair, north-west part. Coming close or attacking the mushrooms will lead to the fight with one fungal tyrant, three abominations and five hunters. Slaying every single enemy will remove the overgrowing tentacles at the Mansion Gate. After the fight, Anariet will offer the party to come with her to Mansion Gate or join her later.

### Opening the Gate

When party is back to the gate, they see no signs of infestation. Anariet thanks hearoes for help, and says that gate is still closed. She returns back home for a while, since her powers are limited, but before that she gives nature blessing to one of the adventurers, granting a level up (if the character is still level 7). If for some reason party is not full, they can persuade her into helping them. She will join the party as level 7 Druid, Circle of the Stars, High Elf, Acolyte.

After she leaves or stays, party can approach the gate. If they haven't acquired neither Awakened Morning Star (or Corrupted Morning Star/Shard of Morning Star, depending on the choice made in the end of Crypt of Sehanine story arc) nor ???, nothing will happen. Attempts to bypass the barrier will result in taking 1d10 Force damage and falling prone. If at least one item is present, mysterious voice says "Wonderers, present the Gifts". If only one item is presented, voice says "Two Gifts for the Heir". If both are presented, voice says "The Heir awaits you", lifts the barrier and opens the gate.

This is a no return point. After passing the gate, door behind will be closed and party will enter the final part of the adventure. Continue the adventure as described in Chapter 4.


## Sunrise Keep

### Arriving to Sunrise Keep

![](img/locations/sunrise-keep.png)

>Lord Eavalur 

Bathroom - ???

Underground hall - room with statues connected to cells, small cave and library. When party passes after triggering any of the secret doors, fight with 6 animated statues will trigger.

Cells - room with eight prison cells, north-east one has broken door and a note from prisoner saying:

>I know, the Star is hidden somewhere here, within the keep walls. If only I would be more lucky and didn't get caught! Whatever, when they dragged me to my cell I noticed cracks in one of the walls, must be some sort of cavern or underground pass. I think it's possible to crack the cell door with a stone, take a couple of brick from the wall to make it collapse and slip away. Let's just wait for the night...

Small cave - hall in the wall leads to a cave filled with luminescent fungi. Under the fallen rock party can find crushed skeleton and Ring of Protection. Retrieveing the ring will trigger the fight with four fungi hunters and one fungi abomination.

Library - has a secret door to treasury (WIS (Perceprtion) DC 18).

Treasury - contains 5000G worth of valuables in total and Amulet of the Devout +1. Amulet lies on a pedestal, and lifting it will trigger magic trap dealing everyone who can see it 4d8 Radiant damage (WIS (Perception) check DC20 to spot, can be deactivated only by dispelling magic from the pedestal). Connected to library, also can be reached from chapel but cannot return back.

### Meeting Neshat

![Night Sky](img/locations/night-sky.png)
_Night sky_

After failing to understand anything about the stars, Seimur is disappointed and runs downstairs to the inner court, shouting about all it. When you meet him there, first he rants about their failure and ask about other ideas. Here, flaming figure appears called Neshat (INT (Arcane) check DC15 will help recognize her as Yfreete, any Warlock will succeed automatically).

![Neshat](img/chars/neshat.png)
_Neshat_

She introduces herself, then complains about Seimur receiveing her help and knowledge about elven magic in this place, and accuses him of not fulfilling his agreement in two weeks as promised; after the dialogue burns his body to death. If party already picked up the rusted morning star, she says something like "Oh, I ALREADY see you are more capable than this worm". Either way she offers a pact to a non-Warlock. If one of the adventurers agrees, they receive one level of Warlock, The Genie (Yfreete), and if required, a hint "Why don't you look for the star somewhere else? Maybe not in the sky?". Burnt Seimur's skull works as a Genie essense. "As a reminder about my generousity", she says. Also, once per adventure, before pact keeper dies, she will save him from the battlefield by transporting into demiplane where mephit servants will fully patch him and send back to his party in 8 hours.

In exchange, she asks players to find and kill one of her kind, who helped to corrupt this place. She gives the same amount of time, two weeks, to fulfill the contract.

Seimur drops 400G, Studded Leather, Cloak of Protection, Shortsword +1, Potion of Greater Healing, Ancient Map, Fey Lantern, and, if retrieved in prologue, Family Pocket Watch.

At this point, it is recommended to get the morning star, complete a long rest and start exploring the map.

## Temple of Corellon Larethian

### Arriving at the Temple

![Temple of Corellon Larethian](img/locations/temple-of-corellon-larethian.png)

### Discovering Temple

Temple has the following locations.

Entrance, south part.

Chapel, east part. Has a Ring of Mind Shielding laying on the pedestal. Taking this ring will trigger fight against ghosts/undeads. Attuning to this ring will reveal that it is inhabited by the spirit of lady Tinuviel, wife of lord Eavalur. She will talk in Elvish, revealing her name, her past of being not welcome by her husband for giving a birth to a daughter. She was praying for her dead friend Quenya, when something killed her, and her spirit was locked in the ring only knowing darkness and emptyness since. She will ask the party to check on the tree she planted on the graveyard as a part of ritual to honor Quenya's memory. Then she promises to show the way to the second gift.

Treasure room, east part, behind the secret door DC20. Contains 4000G in treasures.

Graveyard, west part. Has a giant oak growing among the graves, and a lot of daisies near it's roots. If someone is wearing the Ring of Mind Shielding, the lady will try to take one of the flowers by character's hand (CHA saving throw DC20 to resist). If character touches the flowers, ghosts and undead will appear. After the interaction, lady will say "Gift is hidden beneath the foot of The Protector, but beware those who sworn to him".

![Great Oak](img/locations/great-oak.png)
_Great oak_

Main hall, north part. Statues of two elven warriors and Corellon Larethian himself located here. Serves as an arena for Divine Twins fight.

### Divine Twins

![Dancing Sun](img/chars/dancing-sun.png)
_Dancing Sun, twin-protector_

![Silent Moon](img/chars/silent-moon.png)
_Silent Moon, twin-protector_

When party enters the main hall after fulfilling lady's request, they will see a spectral figure bending a knee in front of Corellian statue. If stranger notices the party, he turns arond facing them, then two flaming curved swords appear in his hands. At the same time, two companion statues come to life. Also, behind one of the columns another figure will appear, an elven woman wearing icy longbow. Silently, they will stare at the party for a moment and then attack.

After the fight, lady will ask ring wearer to come close to the central statue, and tell mhim the words which unseal the gift. Then her spirit peacefully leaves the ring. Inside a secret niche, party will find Blazing Oathkeeper, longbow which was purposed to be another gift. The ringbearer is granted a level up (or another character, if ringbearer is already level 8). Also, there will be a queen's revelation note with the following text:

>Here I am, Tinuviel, lady of this land, yet abandoned by everyone, even my husband. I have to spend days and days alone in this temple, praying to the Protector. Protector, who failed to protect my dearest friend. What an irony! The only thing I hope for is my daughter's happiness with this man. While she is carrying a child, I should try my best to prepare the ideal gift for the ritual of birthgiving. If this is a boy, maybe he will bring peace to this land. After all, all I have at this point, is hope...

## Watchtower
![Watchtower](img/locations/watchtower.png)
_Elven watchtower_

### Arriving to Watchtower

When players first arrive to Watchtower, read the following:

_TO DO: Watchtower flavor text_

Near the entrance, the party discovers a corpse of a halfling, face down. Near it, broken lantern is found. It's spotten with some glittering blue dust, and inside strange piece of meat can be found. Successfull WIS (Medicine) check DC 15 will help identifying it as a heart of some small domestic animal. If adventurers decide to investigate the corpse, character who actually comes in contact and turns the corpse over, will be attacked by a spider, and it will start a fight with six swamp spiders and one spiderfrog with the surprize round. Successfull WIS (Perception) check DC 18 will make attack miss and eliminate the surprize effect.

After dealing with the ambush, group can enter the tower.

Looting the corpse will give one Potion of Greater Healing and a ring with family crest.

### Exploring Watchtower

Ground level has a chest hidden behind the tower in spiderweb, contains 800G and Potion of Growth.

There is some rusty equipment inside the tower, and a way upstairs.

On the top level, there is an abandoned camp with a bit of food, bedrolls and travel bags, can be looted for 1d4+3 rations and two Potions of Healing.

Also on a table lies a weird artifact, looking like a closed eye. Players can figure out how to trigger it, and it will open, look at the party, and shortly after, a portal will open on the floor, where stones are burned. This portal will take all members who were standing at the four central tiles to Cormyr.

### Portal to Cormyr

![Dancing Dragon](img/locations/dancing-dragon-inn-room.png)
_Dancing Dragon_

When party steps into the portal, they find themselves in some sort of tavern room. To be more specific, in big wooden hall, encircled in a spherical barrier (Sphere of Vulnerability) and floor filled with runes (Zone of Truth).

_Adelmain Torst_

![Brandon](img/chars/brandon-torst.png)
_Brandon Torst_

![Selinna](img/chars/selinna.png)
_Selinna_

In the room, there are three short humanoids: a dwarf in fine clothes (Adelmain) looking at them nervously, another dwarf in guard armor (Brandon) and young gnomish girl excited about anything that happens (Selinna). Adelmain is cautious about newcomers and ask adventurers to introduce themselves, but will soften his voice if anyone is wearing Morning Star (not rusty) openly. After quick convo he will eliminate the barriers and introduce himself as mage and historian of Cormyr Academy, his cousin Brandon as guard watcher and Selinna as his student and apprentice, also letting party know they are in Suzail, capital city of Cormyr. To be precise, in Dancing Dragon Inn.

Adelmain will mostly speak in this scene. If halfling corpse is mentioned, he will sadly tell it was Viggy, his other student, who was eager to explore the wood but never returned. 
In short what has happened, several months ago Adelmain discovered that all historical records regarding the south part of the Reaching Woods abruptly end around eighty years ago. Back then, it was the residence of elven lord Eavalur and his wife, lady ???. They had a daughter named ???, lived in prosperity and maintained peaceful agreement with Elturgard, and suddenly, there is no evidence of what happened after. Adelamain saw it as perfect oportunity to prove himself as a scientist and decided to conduct research.

He picked two of his best students, Viggy and Selinna, and travelled to the edge of the Wood of Echoes. Unfortunately, magic mist was unpassable, and all he was able to see was the top of watchtower above the treetops. They returned back to Cormyr and started researching all about elven magic, which could take place, and were able to discover the formula which counters the corruption. The trick is to infuse beating heart of a Fey creature (he will nervously look at such creature if present in the party) with refined saphyre dust. This will create a source of light which is capable of withstanding the elven charms. Mist is a weak charm, but the more you travel, the more insane you become. But cutting a heart from the chest of living creature is a horrible thing, so he used a service of some smugglers to catch a pixie, and paid a fortune to an artificer to do the job, in the name of science, of course.

They kept all of this in secret, so Adelmain was surprised when a drow showed up at his door and started asking about the research. Historian refused to tell him anything, as he knew that the guy was suspicious, and couple of days later Adelmain discovered that some notes about the formula and a copy of map were stolen.

But this wasn't a problem. he already knew all that was available, calculated location of the portal which he needed to open at the top of Watchtower, asked his cousin to gather supplies and they stepped inside. As he hoped, lantern worked perfectly well, so they stayed at the top of watchtower for the night. In the morning, they found out Viggy is missing, as well as the lantern, so they couldn't go downstairs and explore the surroundings. Half an hour later they heard Villy screaming and running towards the tower, when a giant spider jumped on him, breaking the lantern. The expedition was over, three of them had nothing but to return back to the tavern and think about covering it all up. At this point, characters arrive through the portal.

If players show him the lantern, he mentions Seimur again, and asks out loud "How did he got the heart?" (He lured his brother into an evil practicioner's lair, tied him up, cut his heart and the mentioned warlock created the lantern. Then drow killed the artisan to keep secret). He allows the party to keep everything, only asking for notes, documents and manuscripts, which will help uncover the truth about said place.

In return, he will be able to get any gear they want, including unlimited Common items at their normal price (or 10GP), and two Uncommon (3000G or triple the price of a Common counterpart, whichever is higher) or Rare items (8000G or eight times the price of a Common counterpart, whichever is higher). Heroes mention the item list, and all of it will be available in 24 hours. When they trigger the portal next time, Adelmain will wait for gold and scribings, in return giving them the items, as well as additional Magic Scrolls for each piece of knowlenge found. Additionally, he will be able to ask for help, bringing new characters in case any PC died. Player and DM should agree on a reasonable character, which can be brought as reinforcement.

Finally, Adelmain says that the whole thing becomes too risky and he will only open the portal once, after that closing the expedition and getting back to his books. He asks party to leave the room, before anyone noticed.

### Returning the Manuscripts

Once player come back and trigger the portal once again after a full day, Adelmain will open the way. He will ask for gold, in return giving all the requested items, and rewards for the found notes as per table below:

|Record|Location|Rewarded Scroll|
|-|-|-|
|Commander's Instructions|Sunrise Keep, Ground Level|Charm Monster|
|Prisoner's Note|Sunrise Keep, Underground Level|Knock|
|Lord's Diary Page|Crypt of Sehanine|Cone of Cold|
|Lady's Revelation|Shrihe of Corellon Larethian|Flame Strike|
|Servant's Note|Mansion Gate, Fungal Cave|Locate Creature|

Bringing him at least two notes is required for the trade to happen. Bringing three notes, including Lord's Diary Page or Lady's Revelation, will get the party Arcane Grimoire +1. Bringing four notes and both special records will grant Arcane Grimoire +2. Bringing all five notes and telling him about the Judge and lady Tinuviel's spirit will grant Black Grimoire (Arcane Grimoire +2, which gives the attuned character the ability to change prepared spells at Short Rest).

After trade is complete, Adelmain will thank players again for help and close the portal for the last time.

# Minor Locations and Events

This chapter contains descriptions for all the minor locations and encounters across the Wood of Echoes. Some of them are just miscellaneous events, like finding a hidden stash or a peculiar statue, but there are also ambushes, trapped paths and challenging battles. Each of these events is to be triggered only once, when party enters a new section of the wood for the first time. If an event allows for a fighting sequence, suggested battlemap from Appendix D will be linked.

## Bottled Surprise

![Bottled Surprise](img/locations/bottled-surprise.png)

Party is going throught the forest when one of the members missteps. They make DEX (Acrobatics) check DC15, and if they fail, fall and take 1d6 damage. Then they notice a bottled message laying between the roots. Note inside says the following:

>Donny, tomorrow I am leaving the village to join the monastery. They require us to get rid of all the material wealth, so I put all my savings everything in a chest and dug in one of the ruined houses on the edge of the village. You know the one I'm talking about. When you dig it up, keep everything. Love you, Vik

The treasure is buried in the north-west house ruins in the Abandoned village, one person with shovel and three hours of work are required to dig it up. Each additional person with the shovel reduces the time by half an hour. Digging in more than one place a day gets character one level of exaustion.

## Chapel Ruins

Party comes across ruins of a small building. They can find some gold and scrolls inside, triggering a fight with a random group. Use Forest Ruins battlemap.

## Graveyard

## Hunting Spot

Party comes across a hunting spot with hidden bear traps. Traps deal 1d6 Piercing damage and can inflict Filth Fever disease (CON save DC15).

## Lonely Grave

## Ritual Site

Party comes across a ritual site. They can find Bloodwell Vial +1, triggering fight with ghosts.

## Secret Cave

One of the party members missteps and falls into a hidden cave, 20ft high. They can step down and find a way out together, or rescue the adventurer. Cave is inhabited by spiders.

## Unfortunate Villager

![Unfortunate Villager](img/locations/unfortunate-villager.png)
_Unfortunate Villager_

Group discovers a humanoid skeleton, somebody semmingly lost their way in the woods and drawned in the swamp. If party decides to search the surroundings, they will find Flower Ornated Key spending 1d4 hours. This key opens Flower Ornated Lockbox in the Abandoned Village.

## Yuan-Ti Scouts

![Yuan-Ti Scouts](img/chars/yuan-ti-scouts.png)
_Yuan-Ti Scouts

Group is met by yuan-ti scouts. Warlock, leading them, steps ahead and greets the adventurers. Then says "encircle them" in Abyssal, which can be heard and recognized by one of the players. Succesfull translation will eliminate surprize round. Party will encounter three warriors, two archers, one warlock and two vipers sneaking from behind. Use Swamp (day or night) battle map from Appendix D for this fight. All scouts drop their weapon, warlock drops Rod of the Pact Keeper +1.

Only Grung and Yuan-Ti will recognise Yuan-ti and their racial traits, other races will have to pass INT (Investigation) check DC15. Grung will also receive Frightened condition until the fight is over or until it kills one of the scouts.

# Finale

Before entering the finale chapter, Neshat will appear and warn the adventurers, that there might be no way back after they pass the gate. If players decide to proceed, she will grant another level of Genie Warlock to the pactbearer, and then disappear. Here, grant all the others level 8. Gates will be sealed behind the party, and force barrier will reappear.
